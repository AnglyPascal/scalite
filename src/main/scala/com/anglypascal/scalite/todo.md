# TODO List

## Context Handler

- Go around checking the model. Adding logs while you're at it. Attention:
    - Effects of the immutable Data

- Write the string handlers:
    - `slugify()`: converts string into lower-case, hyphen seperated string. 
        - challenge is to add customization. For now, copy jekyll
    - `prettify():` takes a string, maybe slugified, and creates a nice english rep.
        - again, challenge is to support customization.
    - `excerpt()`: module for posts, that creates an excerpt of the post. Copy jekyll
        for now.

- Start with global settings handling. Write the specification for items
    - We don't need many options to handle posts. Then check the code for posts, and
        test a small case.
    - Check url creation, that it words and the partials work.
    - Then add the collection configurations in global settings.
        - Collections can be specified to have a table of contents page. 

- Make a directory builder and file writer
    - Inside collection items, define the output path. It should be defined by the url.
    - Write a file copier that copies static files.
    - While you're at it, look into the caching system.

- Write a Main object, with only one option for now: `build`. 

- On the meantime, take care of sass rendering. I don't know how themeing will work, so
    need to take a closer look.
    - I think it's just compile everything in the `_sass` folder, and put everything
        inside `/assets/css/style.css` file

- Front matter documentation, and other documentations. Work on this as you go.


## A bit later

- Give a API that allows a custom function mapped to a placeholder with signature maybe 
    ``` scala
    () => String
    String => String
    ```
    which will be used when `{{function_key}}` is used in mustache layouts.

- We can also allow for custom placeholder classes to be passed to the renderer via the
    MustacheHelper trait. 

    For example, if someone wants to output the render time of the post, they will
    define an extension to the mustache helper (give it a different name) and simply
    define a function with the name `render()` and the output will be returnd by this
    funciton. More functionality can obviously be achieved by exploiting the behaviour
    of mustache library

- Write a public API named Plugin that will handle the object fetching from the
    `_plugins` directory by adding them to the classpath. Also it will handle the
    object initialization so that they are properly processed. Will need an API for
    this as well.

- Localized theming for layouts? Is it possible?
