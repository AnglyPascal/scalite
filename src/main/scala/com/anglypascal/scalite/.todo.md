List of Things to do now

- [ ] Write logic that adds support for Collections

- [ ] Write a generic system to allow for generic Collection creation like Tag/Category

- [ ] Implement writers in the command pattern. 
  - [ ] Inside writers module there need to be a file cleaner
  - [ ] Make a cache system

- [ ] Need to add the logger

- [ ] Write the main Site object? Or class? Decide how to go on about that global
influence

- [ ] Sort out the front matter documentation. The way to do this is to give an api
      for the front matter in a separate file like Global

- [ ] Command system, support for build, new, serve, clean

- [ ] give an api for a custom tag. For example, if someone wants to output the render
time of the post, they will define an extension to the mustache helper (give it a
different name) and simply define a function with the name "render()" and the output
will be returnd by this funciton. More functionality can obviously be achieved by
exploiting the behaviour of mustache library

- [ ] Make a Plugin class, that provides a public api to add plugins. Add support for
plugins, converters, and such by adding a function in the converters class that lets
users to add a plugin without editing the source file. Define the "addStuff" method



Testing
